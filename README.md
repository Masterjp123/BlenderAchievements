# 🏆 Blender Achievements Add-on

Currently there is no addon avalible but I'm working on it!
A fun, extensible achievement system for Blender that rewards your creative milestones!  
Track everything from your first render to modeling madness—all while keeping it fully open-source and user-powered.
Also Keep in mind this was purely made as a lol haha funni idea, please don't roast me in the issues about how this is an impractical idea, TRUST ME I KNOW IT IS.

## 🎯 How It Works

- Achievements are defined entirely in `.json` files inside the `achievements/` folder
- Each entry includes:
```json
{
 "id": "unique_id",
 "name": "Super Modeler",
 "description": "Reach 1 million vertices",
 "trigger": "vertex_count",
 "threshold": 1000000,
 "icon": "super_modeler.png"
}
